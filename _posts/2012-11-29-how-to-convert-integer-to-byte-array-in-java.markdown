This post demonstrates how to convert integer to byte array in java and to convert byte array to integer. It shows low level and high level byte operations.



	
  * In java, integer takes four bytes. So it is assumed that byte array is of length 4.

	
  * Byte order can be LITTLE_ENDIAN or BIG_ENDIAN


A short note on endianness:
For LITTLE_ENDIAN : Least significant bit is at lowest memory address
For BIG_ENDIAN : Most significant bit is at lowest memory address
