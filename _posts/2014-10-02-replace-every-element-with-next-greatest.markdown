## Problem: Replace Every Element With Next Greatest

Given an array of integers, replace every element with next greatest element.Since there is no element next to the last element, replace it with -1.

In an array of a1 to aN, replace ai with \\( max (ai+1 â€¦. aN) \\) where  \\( 0 < i < N \\) and aN with -1


## Solution

* Consider the array with only positive integers. 
* Initially set maximum element as -1. 
* Start from the N-1th element, move to the left side one by one, and keep track of the maximum element. 
* Replace every element with the maximum element.

What if our array contains negative integers too?

### Modified solution

* Initially set maximum element as Integer.MIN_VALUE. 
* Start from the N-1th element, move to the left side one by one, and keep track of the maximum element. 
* Replace every element with the maximum element. And Finally set the last element to -1.
